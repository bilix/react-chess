# React Chess

This is a work in progress. Just a react chess simulator I'm building for fun.<br />
For now, you can select pieces and move them, see their available moves, kill enemy pieces, see killed pieces, reset the board.

Open [https://bilix.github.io/react-chess/](https://bilix.github.io/react-chess/) to try it

## TODO

Check, Checkmate, Stalemate, castling, pawn promotion. <br />
Tests. <br />
Improve design.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
